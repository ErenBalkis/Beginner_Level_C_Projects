# Beginner Level C/C++ Projects
Codes that I wrote while learning the C language and thought might be useful.
Short descriptions and quick run instructions for small learning projects.

## Projects
- **ATM Simulation — Bankamatik uygulamasi.cpp**  
  Simple console ATM: check balance, withdraw, deposit, exit. Demonstrates basic I/O, conditionals and loop control. 🏦

- **Reverse Entered Word — Girilen Kelimeyi Ters Cevirme.cpp**  
  Reads a string and prints it reversed. Shows string handling and loops. 🔁

- **Find Max & Min Grades — Max ve Min not bulma.cpp**  
  Reads several grades and outputs maximum and minimum. Uses arrays/iteration and comparison logic. 📊

- **Reverse (C) — Reverse.c**  
  C version of reversing a string/array. Example of pointer/index usage. 🔄

- **Guessing Game (while) — While ile tahmin sorusu.cpp**  
  Number guessing loop using while; gives feedback until correct. Teaches loops and conditionals. 🎯

- **Draw Stars — YıldızÇizme-1.cpp**  
  Prints star patterns (triangles) using nested loops. Good for practice. ⭐️

## How to run
1. Install a C/C++ compiler (gcc/g++ or an IDE like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio).  
2. Compile:
   - C: `gcc Reverse.c -o reverse`
   - C++: `g++ "FileName.cpp" -o program`
3. Run the executable:
   - On macOS/Linux: `./program` or `./reverse`
   - On Windows: double-click the .exe or run `program.exe` from CMD/PowerShell.

## Quick tips
- Input validation is minimal — avoid entering wrong types (e.g., letters where numbers expected).  
- These files focus on basics: control structures, arrays, strings, and console I/O.  
- Improve them by adding functions, better input checks, and comments.  
- To switch between C and C++ styles, adjust includes and string handling (`<string>` / `cstring`).
